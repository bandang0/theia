\begin{alltt}
Write the relevant FreeCAD objects of components in CAD file.

This function is for everything except for beams.
To the doc .fcstd file are added one object per optic and beam, they
    are of type Part::FeaturePython to allow for shapes and features.

The important functions are the PythonFeatures
    constructors found in features, and the shape functions found in shapes.

component: component to represent. [Mirror, Lens, BeamDump, Ghost, Beam]
doc: CAD file to write to. [CAD file]

No return value.

\begin{alltt}
Recursively write the shape and feature content of the beams of a tree.

If the tree's root is not None, write the shape and feature for tree.Root
    and start over for the daughter trees.

tree: beamtree to write the info. [BeamTree]
doc: CAD file to write to. [CAD file]

No return value.
